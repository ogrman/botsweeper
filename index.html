        <h2>Fight the bots!</h2>
        <p>
            Arrow keys, space and F are vital in the fight against bots. Press
            G when you are sure all bots are flagged. R is important when you
            need to restart the fight.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also use the mouse. Point at the screen, and use the three
            buttons.
